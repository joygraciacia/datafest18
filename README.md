 An analysis of 2.5 GB worth of Indeed's dataset. 
 
With the data we received from Indeed, the research question we pursued was: “What majors should college students pursue for jobs in tech and where are those jobs located within California?” Our target audience are students pursuing an undergraduate degree. 

With this in mind, we cleaned and subset our data based jobs with higher education required. Given that students in college probably have little work experience, we accounted for this also. After subsetting the data based on higher education required, we narrowed down our data to jobs requiring less than a year of experience.
